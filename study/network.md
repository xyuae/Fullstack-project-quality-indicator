## Star and hybrid start topologies
The next two topologies I'd like to talk about are the start and hybrid topologies. The star topology, which is more commonly called the hierarchical star topology, is the most common topology used in LANs today. This topology is more expensive than bus topology because it needs more cables. However, one damaged node or cable will not bring down the entire network. In a hierarchical star topology, all the ndoes connec tto a central hub or switch.

This makes it very easy to troubleshoot a hierarchical star configuration. The main problem with a hierarchical star configuration is taht it is susceptible to a single point of failure. 

## OSI model
The OSI model stands fro OPen systems interconnection reference model. All people seem to need data processing. Please do not throw susage and pizza away.
