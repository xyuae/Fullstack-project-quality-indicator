## Design
To guide the first stage of our development, we're going to create two important sets of documents.
These will be our user stories and wireframes.
Our user stories are intended to aid development by providing us with a linear, narrative style description of a hypothetical user's acitons as they utilize our appication.

A wireframe is a visual, someitmes interactive, repesentation of an application that often focuses less on the application's specific graphic design elements and instead emphasizes the layout, features, functionality, and broader user experience.
